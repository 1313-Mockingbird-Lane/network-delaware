### Tech Stack

#### NextJS

NextJS is a wrapper around React which allows the app to be rendered serverside first. Once open in the browser it can behave like a _Single Page React App_.

#### React Bootstrap

Bootstrap re-written for react so that jQuery does not have to be used (they don't play well).
